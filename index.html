        <div class="subheading mb-5">Computer Science</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"><br>My name is Leslie Lau  and I am a web developer for the most well known companies. I am an accomplished coder and programmer, and I enjoy using my skills to contribute to the exciting technological advances that happen every day at my company that I created. I am a college student ready to pursue a career that is fit in with my major. While in school, I earned the medal for being the most well organized student and was able to give a speech to my fellow classmates about my accomplishments that I was able to have while at college.
        
I took an entry level position at a volunteer job that I had interviewed for and was promoted to my current position while working there for the past few years as a good employee. I am obsessed with all things tech-related and I spend my free time building computers and developing my own software. I enjoy watching sci-fi movies, walking my Great Dane on Newport Beach and eating seafood tacos at local California Mexican restaurants.
<br>

        I am ready to give my career a boost and be able to create more with the dedication that I am willing to have in the position. There are many advantages that I will give to the company on top of my passion for coding for the company that I love. I will be able to provide the company with outstanding improvements. There are many things that I love to do besides coding and that is going to the beach with my family and just spending time some time together. With the large amount of people wanting to get this position, I am going to be the person most worthy since I am a well organized person who will be able to provide ideas that will help the company grow. 
As for the things that I do outside of coding, I like watching movies and being able to relax when times get stressful. So I hope that there will be nice vacations that will be given to employees who are on the top of their job. It will give me motivation to do better when I get back to the job after the vacation. It is just a suggestion and I think it is a good one that many employees would like to have. Other than that, there are many people that I look up to. One of which is Steve Jobs since he was able to create the smartphone that so many people in the world are using right now. There is just a tremendous amount of those who will be willing to work for the company and I would like to be a part of it.
<br><br>

        I have had lots of experience with computers and therefore would be a fit employee for this position. I am going to make the company a much better place for everyone to enjoy, and will give my all to help this company be able to thrive in success as well as be able to gain so much more advancements in the technology that has come with the development of what it has become.
